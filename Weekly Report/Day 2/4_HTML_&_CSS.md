### Summary
>
CSS Solved a Big Problem. HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
The most popular way to link or add CSS to HTML is externally. Doing everything in the HTML doc is clustersome.

The DOM is made up of Nodes(Individual objects that are then branched into trees)
-The DOM allows developers to build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. 

The Dev Tools allow you to visual see what your text edited code is doing in the backend. You can point to individual assets(Text, Links, Logos, Images, etc.) on screen and see what code it's associated with.
