## Git Repo Reflections

## Objectives
- [x] Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository
- [x] Describe what open source is to a friend
- [x] Explain the importance of using licenses in repos 

### What is a repo?
> A repository. Can be either local(personal/offline) or remote(hosted somwhere else. Github. BitBucket....)

### What is open source?
> Software that is publicly accessible, used, modifed/code, and shared.

### What are some different types of licenses, and when would you use them?
> MIT License - Has the least restrictions on users. Very user friendly. Open

  Apache License - Must notify users of code mods. If credit will be due to all who works on the project. Can't copyright, patent or trademark
  
  BSD - If the project outcome is unknown. Use if you think the program will become valueable

  General Public License (GPL) - Has to be GPL from start to finsh

### Summary
> A repository is like having your own personaly database of information that you can edit from anywhere as long as it's distributed.

Open source is dope. Free stuff!

Make sure to license you software. Licenses have guidelines to follow and repos add more workability and redundancy to the code you're working on.
