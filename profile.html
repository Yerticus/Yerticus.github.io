<h1>My Bio</h1>
<p>Being from <b>Detroit, MI</b>, I have always been a proponent of hard work and dedication.
    I am always seeking to develop myself through various avenues of work, hobbies and 
    education systems.
</p>
<p>I started my plunge into the workforce by becoming a delivery driver at Jimmy John's 
    in <b>Clinton Township, MI</b>. At the same time I was attending Macomb Community College<br> 
    to complete general education courses.
    I was primarily enrolled in their Mechatronics program, obtaining basic knowledge 
    in <i>robotics, pneumatic systems,<br> 
    CNC programming/operation, electrical and mechanical engineering.</i>>
    I graduated in 2014 with my <i>Associate's Degree in General Studies</i>.
</p>

<p>After graduating I wanted to see what career options there were in Michigan. 
    The economy was on a steady decline and most jobs/careers involved the 
    automotive industry.<br> 
    The Flint Water Crisis didn't help matters either. I started my first semester at 
    Wayne State University in 2015, studying <i>Industrial/Product Design</i>. 
    I decided to take a break <br>
    after the first year because I knew there were more 
    fitting opportunities, just not in the comfort of my own backyard.<br>
</p>


<p>I moved to <b>North Dallas, TX</b> in 2016 and throughout that first year. 
    I explored Texas, built my social network and I worked at The Colony Home Depot. <br> 
    I continue my martial arts and self defense training at Plano Martial Arts. 
    By the Summer of 2017, I became a certified kickboxing coach at TITLE Boxing Club 
    in Frisco. <br>
     My main goal was to help others achieve their fitness goals and teach the importance 
     of self defense and awareness. From an enthusiast perspective, I spend a lot of time <br>
     developing my technique through visiting gyms in the DFW area. I've trained with various 
     teachers, students, pro and amatuer fighters in <i>Boxing, Muay Thai, Taekwondo,<br> 
     Hapkido, Wing Chun, Kendo/Kenjustu(Japanese Sword) and Traditional Japanese Jujutsu.</i>
