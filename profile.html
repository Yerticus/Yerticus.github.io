    I was born and raised in <b>Detroit, MI</b>. Attended Macomb Community College studying Mechatronics.<br> 
    Gain knowledge in <i>robotics, pneumatic systems, CNC programming/operation, electrical and<br>
    mechanical engineering</i>. I graduated in 2014 with my Associate's Degree in General Studies.
</p>
<p>
    After graduating I studied at Wayne State University in 2015, studying Industrial/Product Design.
</p>
<p>
    In 2016, I decided to move to <b>North Dallas, TX</b> and build my social network and explore career opportunities.<br> 
    Martial Arts is a great hobby of mine and Iâ€™ve been practicing since 2012. I continued my self defense training<br>
    at Plano Martial Arts.

    By the Summer of 2017, I became a certified Kickboxing Coach at TITLE Boxing Club in Frisco.<br>
    My main goal was to help others achieve their fitness goals and teach the importance of self defense and awareness.<br> 
    From an enthusiast perspective, I spend a lot of time developing my technique through visiting gyms in the DFW area.<br>
    I continue to train with various teachers, students, and professionals.
